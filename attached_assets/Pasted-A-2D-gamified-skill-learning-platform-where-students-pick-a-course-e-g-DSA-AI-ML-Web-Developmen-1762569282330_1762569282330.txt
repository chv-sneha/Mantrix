A 2D gamified skill-learning platform where students pick a course (e.g., DSA, AI/ML, Web Development) and progress through a story-driven roadmap. Each topic level is a game/challenge designed for mastery, and AI acts as an autonomous study buddy and guide.

1. Gamified Frontend
- Beautiful 2D world with interactive navigation.
- Navigation bar with items: Home, Courses, Progress, Profile.
- Login/signup page for personalized experience.
- Each course has a visual roadmap (levels or stages) with progress tracking.

2. Courses & Roadmaps
- Users choose a course (e.g., DSA, AI/ML, Cloud & DevOps, Web Development).
- Each course has multiple levels: beginner → advanced (topic-wise levels).
- Roadmap is gamified, showing levels like quests, challenges, or mini-bosses.

3. AI-Driven Learning Companion
- When a user selects a topic, the AI introduces a basic concept and then generates a challenge/game related to it.
- Example: If the user picks DSA, Level 1 might be “Introduction to Programming,” with a mini-game teaching loops or variables.
- Completing the challenge earns points, and AI recommends the next level or a video resource (like YouTube) automatically.
- AI recommends next topics or videos based on performance.
- Plans adaptive challenges based on user skill.
- Explains concepts, quizzes users, and guides them through coding or conceptual challenges.
- Stores memory of user progress and adjusts difficulty intelligently.

4. Story-Driven Challenges
- Each level has a narrative linked to its learning objective.
- Example (DSA): Level 1 → “Introduction to Programming” (mini-game teaching loops/variables).
- Example (Web Dev): Level 1 → “HTML Basics” (mini-game building a simple web structure).
- Completing challenges earns points, badges, and unlocks new levels.

5. Coding & Problem-Solving Integration
- For technical courses like DSA, integrates coding problems similar to LeetCode or HackerRank.
- AI suggests hints, explains solutions, or recommends tutorials after challenge completion.

6. Rewards & Motivation
- Completing courses unlocks badges, certificates, or gamified rewards.
- AI provides adaptive suggestions and motivation to maximize learning and engagement.
