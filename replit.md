# SkillQuest - Gamified Learning Platform

## Overview

SkillQuest is a 2D gamified skill-learning platform where students embark on story-driven educational journeys. Users select courses (DSA, AI/ML, Web Development, Cloud & DevOps, etc.) and progress through interactive levels designed as game-like challenges. The platform features an AI-powered learning companion that provides personalized hints, generates adaptive challenges, offers explanations, and delivers motivational messages based on user performance.

### MATRIX: Cloud & DevOps Odyssey
Implemented a comprehensive 9-level Cloud & DevOps course following the "Skyforge Realm" narrative theme:
1. **The Genesis Cloud** - Cloud Computing fundamentals (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, AWS/Azure/GCP)
2. **The Forge of Infrastructure** - Networking & Compute (VPC, EC2, S3, Load Balancers)
3. **The Chamber of Automation** - DevOps Foundations (CI/CD, Git, GitHub Actions)
4. **The Terraform Plains** - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform basics and provisioning)
5. **The Docker Depths** - Containerization (Docker, images, volumes, networking)
6. **The Kubernetes Peaks** - Container Orchestration (K8s pods, deployments, services)
7. **The CI/CD Citadel** - Pipeline Automation (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
8. **The Realm of Observability** - Monitoring & Logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack)
9. **The DevOps Devas** - Full Integration (DevSecOps, cost optimization, production best practices)

Each level includes:
- Engaging narrative following the Skyforge Realm storyline
- 3 AI-curated YouTube video tutorials
- 3 quiz questions with detailed explanations
- External practice resources (AWS docs, Azure tutorials, hands-on labs)
- Interactive game component using existing game engines (ComponentLink, DataBridge, ScriptCircuit, PatternBuilder, DeployOrbit, SearchChallenge)

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build System:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- Vite as the build tool and development server with custom configuration for client-side routing
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling with custom game-themed color palette and animations
- Radix UI component library for accessible, unstyled UI primitives

**State Management:**
- Custom Zustand stores for client-side state:
  - `useLearning` - manages courses, levels, user progress, XP, badges, and AI companion interactions
  - `useAudio` - controls background music, sound effects (hit, success), and mute state
  - `useGame` - handles game-specific state and phase management
- React Query for server state management and API communication

**Routing & Navigation:**
- Client-side page routing via state management (no router library)
- Pages: Home, Courses, Progress, Profile, Challenge
- Navigation component with responsive design and XP/level display

**UI/UX Design Decisions:**
- Gaming-first aesthetic with glowing effects, animations, and retro fonts (Press Start 2P, VT323, Orbitron)
- Responsive design supporting mobile and desktop viewports
- Custom 3D rendering support via React Three Fiber and Drei for future enhancement
- GLSL shader support for advanced visual effects

**Component Architecture:**
- Presentational components separated from container components
- Shared UI component library under `client/src/components/ui/`
- Custom components:
  - **AssessmentHub**: Combined quiz and coding challenge interface with test runner and AI hints
  - **VideoRecommendations**: AI-powered video suggestions before assessments
  - **ResourcesPanel**: External practice resources (LeetCode, NeetCode, W3Schools, MDN)
  - **TeachingGame**: Interactive 3D mini-games for learning concepts
  - **GameArena**: Full game experience with briefing and results
  - **Navigation**: Responsive navbar with XP/level display
- Atomic design pattern with reusable button, card, dialog, and form components

**Game System:**
- React Three Fiber (R3F) for 3D game rendering
- KeyboardControls from @react-three/drei for player input
- Three playable mini-games integrated into learning flow:
  - **Loop Arena**: Collect items in a 3D arena using WASD/Arrow keys, teaches loops and iteration
  - **Recursion Maze**: Navigate through maze with wall collision detection, teaches recursive thinking
  - **Sorting Conveyor**: Interactive click-to-swap sorting game, teaches sorting algorithms
- **MATRIX Learning Flow**: Narrative → Teaching Game → AI Video Recommendations → Assessment (Quiz + Coding) → Practice Game → External Resources → Level Complete
- Complete integration with XP rewards and progress tracking
- GameArena component manages briefing, gameplay, and results screens
- Game registry system for easy addition of new games

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:**
- Express.js with TypeScript for the REST API
- Custom middleware for request/response logging and error handling
- Separate route registration system for modularity

**API Design:**
- RESTful endpoints under `/api/` prefix
- AI-powered routes:
  - `POST /api/ai/hint` - generates contextual hints for challenges
  - `POST /api/ai/challenge` - creates adaptive challenges based on topic and difficulty
  - `POST /api/ai/explanation` - provides explanations for user answers
  - `POST /api/ai/motivation` - delivers personalized motivational messages

**AI Integration:**
- OpenAI GPT-5 integration for AI learning companion features
- **Contextual Hint System**: AI provides stage-aware hints based on:
  - Current learning stage (narrative, teaching, assessment, etc.)
  - Problem type (quiz questions vs coding challenges)
  - User's code and test results for coding problems
  - Number of attempts to guide difficulty
- UI integration: Hint buttons in both quiz questions and coding challenges
- Graceful degradation when API key is unavailable (fallback messages)
- AI functions designed to be encouraging, educational, and non-spoiling

**Development vs Production:**
- Development: Vite middleware for HMR and fast refresh
- Production: Static file serving from built assets
- Environment-based configuration with clear separation of concerns

### Data Storage Solutions

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL as the primary database (Neon serverless for scalability)
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database interactions and migrations
- Schema-first approach with Zod validation

**Current Schema:**
- `users` table with username/password authentication
- `userProgress` table tracking XP, level, current course/level
- `completedLevels` table recording level completion and XP earned
- `badges` table storing earned achievements
- `certificates` table for course completion certificates
- `gameSessions` table tracking individual game plays with score, time, and XP
- `codingAttempts` table for tracking code submissions and test results
- Insert schemas with Zod validation for type safety

**In-Memory Storage:**
- `MemStorage` class provides in-memory implementation of IStorage interface
- Used for development and testing without database dependency
- Supports user CRUD operations with auto-incrementing IDs
